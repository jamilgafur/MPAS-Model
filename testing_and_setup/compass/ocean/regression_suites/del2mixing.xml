<!--
This regression suite follows the test cases from Petersen et al. (2015):

1. lock exchange, 0.5km
2. overflow, 1km
3. internal gravity wave, 5km
4. baroclinic channel: 1, 4, 10km

The purpose of these tests is to measure the change in the Reference Potential
Energy (RPE), which is a measure of mixing. These tests are set to have zero
horizontal and vertical tracer diffusion and zero surface fluxes, so all mixing
measured by RPE is due to spurious numerical diffusion.
